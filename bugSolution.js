The solution involves removing the `@apply` directive from the JavaScript code and directly applying the desired Tailwind classes. For instance:

```javascript
<script>
  function myDirective(el) {
    el.classList.add('bg-blue-500');
    el.classList.add('text-white'); // Correct: directly add classes
  }
</script>
```

By adding the classes (`bg-blue-500` and `text-white`) directly to the element's class list, the styles are correctly applied. This approach avoids the misuse of the `@apply` directive, which is meant only for compile-time processing.
